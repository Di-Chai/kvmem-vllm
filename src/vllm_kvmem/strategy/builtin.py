"""The strategies shipped with the package.

Entries marked native are serving's existing code paths: the per-layer MeanK
Query scores, the accumulated-attention pressure scores, the native store
picker and the native historical-GC policies. They are listed so that a
profile can name them and the strategy table is complete; serving runs them
unchanged. The recency scorers are the lower reference for comparisons: they
keep what is most recent and ignore content.
